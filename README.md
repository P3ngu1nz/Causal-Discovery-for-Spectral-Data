Datasets for CDI calculating
- bands.csv: peak postions, heights, and weights for spectra simulation.
- cdi results.xlsx: CDI-DCOR & CDI-E with the input of maximum absorbance from raw spectra (1) and 2nd derivative spectra (2), and PC1 scores (3).
- y and z.xlsx: independent values (response and interference) from the internal and external datasets.
- x.xlsx: simulated spectra from the internal (only causally related region) and external (only maximum absorbance) datasets. Due to storage difficulties and memory limitation, the original data processed by Python can only be uploaded partly as described priorly.

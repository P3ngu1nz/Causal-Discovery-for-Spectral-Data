Datasets for CDI calculating
- bands.csv: peak postions, heights, and weights for spectra simulation.
- cdi results.xlsx: CDI-DCOR & CDI-E with the input of maximum absorbance from raw spectra (1) and 2nd derivative spectra (2), and PC1 scores (3).
- y and z.xlsx: independent values (response and interference) from the internal and external datasets.
- x.xlsx: simulated spectra from the internal (all 341 wavelengths) and external (only causally related region - due to storage difficulty) datasets.
